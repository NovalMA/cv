        I am a Licensed Chemical Engineer here in the Philippines who is currently working in the Packaging Industry. I enjoy puzzles that rack the brain to the point of frustration since these are often the ones that are most satisfying when solved - because of this I like to learn new things and explore insights from different avenues. Recently, I have picked up interest in coding and this online Curriculum Vitae (CV) is actually an exercise made entirely with HTML from the Web Development Bootcamp that I am currently taking. Please enjoy this simple yet functional website that I have created, and do contact me with your thoughts, comments and/or suggestions in the link above.
